I am a PhD student at UT Austin advised by <a href="https://amyzhang.github.io/">Amy Zhang</a> working on deep reinforcement learning. I was supported by the NSF Ethical AI Fellowship. I am interested in all sorts of deep reinforcement learning problems but recently I've been thinking about unsupervised learning within decision-making contexts and applying those tools to large-scale robot learning.

Previously, I did work in the Structured Techniques for Algorithmic Robotics lab (<a href="https://star-lab.cc.gatech.edu/">STAR</a>) with Professor <a href="https://harishravichandar.com/">Harish Ravichandar</a> and the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning lab (<a href="https://rail.gatech.edu/">RAIL</a>) with Professor <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~chernova/">Sonia Chernova</a>. I also worked closely with Robotics PhD student <a href="https://www.joannetruong.com/">Joanne Truong</a> on sim2real for legged robotics.

## Other stuff
I like to play tennis and bake. I also run the CS Graduate Student organization (<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gracs/">GRACS</a>) for UTCS.
<!-- I was part of an intern [spotlight](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2020/1/9/intern-turns-head-on-nasas-next-mars-rover/) while working on Mars2020 at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
